# Build log — Standard preview

We are translating interviews with operators into canonical roles, objects, and workflows. The preview is intentionally light but already maps back to day-to-day motions for partner teams.

Key focus areas this month include:

- Aligning job architecture and enablement tracks.
- Drafting shared language for partner lifecycle stages.
- Stress-testing data objects with vendor and partner systems.

Expect updated schema diagrams in the next monthly update.
